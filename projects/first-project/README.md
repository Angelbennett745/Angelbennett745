# Modular Hillside Residential House (BIM/ Architectural CAD)

## Overview
A detailed multi-level residential building designed for sloped terrain, featuring sectional views, structural framing, balconies, staircases, and interior layouts. The project focuses on accurate spatial planning,constructability,and clean parametric modelling for BIM workflows. Deliverables include 3D assemblies, cutaway sections, floor plans, and visualization-ready models for design review and construction documentation

## My Role
Role: CAD/BIM Modeler (Architectural)
Built the full 3D BIM model for a multi-level residential building on sloped terrain, produced plans and sectional views, and prepared visualization-ready models for design review and construction documentation.


## Tools Used
- FreeCAD  
- AutoCAD
- SOLIDWORKS

## Key Features
Multi-level residential layout optimized for sloped terrain

Detailed sectional and cutaway views for structural clarity

Parametric modeling of balconies, staircases, and framing elements

Accurate floor plans with clear spatial zoning (living, service, private areas)

Well-organized assemblies for easy design iteration and updates

Visualization-ready 3D model for design reviews and presentations

Clean layer/component structure for BIM workflows and documentation
