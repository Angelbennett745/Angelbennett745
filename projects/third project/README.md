**Category:** Mechanical CAD / Robotics  
  
**Tools:** 
SOLIDWORKS
AutoCAD

---

## Overview  
A functional robotic gripper assembly created to demonstrate linkages, joints, and controlled motion in a compact mechanical system for automation concepts.

---

##  My Role  
**Mechanical CAD Designer** – modeled parametric parts, assembled components, and defined motion constraints.

---

##  Skills  
- Parametric part modeling  
- Assembly mates and constraints
